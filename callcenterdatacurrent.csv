The dog is vicious and needs to be reported as potentially dangerous. It's ok to have a dog that's protective but if you can't control it that's a public nuisance. I asked for the pets registration and pet liability insurance from the tenant. I haven't received it yet. When I asked the tenant on the 1St floor if she's had similar experiences with the dog, she said it went after her twins one day and she has to be careful when she leaves her apt with the children.

The flashing blue light from this camera cart shines directly past my closed blinds and into my apartment at night, located further down the road at 902 S 25th St. This constant and disruptive light has made it difficult to sleep and has become a significant nuisance.

I attempted to contact McDonald's directly to address the issue, but unfortunately, I did not receive any response. I also called their corporate toll-free number, but no one answered that call either. I am not sure whether McDonald's will take action on their own, so I am reaching out to your department in hopes that you can help resolve this situation.

I would like to request that the flashing blue light be turned off during the night or that the camera cart be moved to another part of the parking lot where the light does not affect nearby residents. This issue is causing unnecessary disturbance and discomfort, and I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in addressing it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any steps you may take to resolve this nuisance.""2025-04-20 00:00:00","8310 W BURLEIGH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-4806","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","branches in alley next to garbage carts""2025-04-20 00:00:00","5730 W HOWARD AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53220-2065","No Mow May Registration","","""2025-04-20 00:00:00","5246 S 20TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53221-3854","Clogged Catch Basin/Surface Flooding","2025-04-20 00:00:00","WATER DEPT NEEDS CB OPEN FOR WORK THEY ARE DOING""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3629 S 84TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53228-1503","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","leaves and brush clippings""2025-04-20 00:00:00","7912 W BRADLEY RD, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53223-3230","Clogged Catch Basin/Surface Flooding","2025-04-20 00:00:00","Basin flooding during rain, Basin drain clog with debris""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3865 N 85TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-2825","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","There are 2 piles as we dont have much of a curb in our cul-de-sac, thank you very much""2025-04-20 00:00:00","1221 N 31ST ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53208-2941","Large Items Discarded on Private Property","","Several tires have been dumped in the alley behind this property""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3930 N 26TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53206-1405","Trim City Tree","","I requested a city tree to be trimmed.

Over the past several weeks, I have noticed the presence of one or two mice on and off within the apartment, and despite my repeated concerns to my landlord, **Devoe Rentals LLC**, the issue has not been adequately addressed.

I have informed the landlord on several occasions about the mice problem, but their response has been dismissive and lacking in action. They have offered excuses and have not taken any concrete steps to resolve the issue. As a tenant, I am paying **$450 per month** for this rental, and I believe it is unacceptable for the landlord to ignore this serious health and safety concern.

I understand that **Devoe Rentals LLC** has a history of similar complaints with your department, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken against this landlord for their failure to maintain the property in a habitable condition. The continued presence of pests in my apartment makes it difficult for me to live in the space comfortably, and I should not have to endure this while paying rent.

I am asking that you investigate this matter further and hold the landlord accountable for not addressing the issue. It is not fair to continue to pay rent in these conditions when they have not taken the necessary steps to address the problem.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.""2025-04-20 00:00:00","902 S 25TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53204-0000","Plumbing Problem","","I am submitting a formal complaint regarding a persistent plumbing issue at **902 S 25th St, Milwaukee, WI 53204**, specifically with the second-floor bathroom tub.

The issue is that the bathtub in this bathroom fills with water whenever the shower head is in use, for no apparent reason. I am unsure whether this is an ongoing issue that has not been reported previously, or if it is a new problem that has gone unnoticed. Regardless, it is causing inconvenience and concerns regarding potential water damage or further plumbing complications.

I have informed my landlord, **Devoe Rentals LLC**, about this problem on several occasions, but they have refused to take any action or address the issue in any way. This lack of response has prompted me to reach out to your department for assistance.

Additionally, I have come to learn that Devoe Rentals LLC has a **history of complaints with the Milwaukee Department of Neighborhood Services**. It appears that they have a pattern of neglecting tenant concerns and providing substandard living conditions while continuing to collect rent payments from hard-working Milwaukee residents. It is disheartening to see that these landlords appear to operate without regard for the well-being or safety of their tenants.

Given the serious nature of the plumbing issue, the landlord’s failure to address it, and their history of neglect, I am requesting that the **Milwaukee Department of Neighborhood Services investigate this matter** as soon as possible. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in ensuring that this issue is resolved in a timely and professional manner.

Thank you for your attention to this complaint. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.""2025-04-19 00:00:00","8042 W CENTER ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-4925","No Mow May Registration","","""2025-04-19 00:00:00","3008 N 60TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53210-1403","No Hot Water","","The landlord is retaliating against my elderly grandmother by turning off her hot water.

Not only is he a hoarder within the home and in his car, which has caused a plethora of insects and vermin to encroach within his property, but his mental illness has progressed, which is decreasing our property values. Kevin throws food on the side walk and within his front yard including: pork knuckle bones, ribs, turkey carcasses, rice, corn flakes, various fruits and vegetables, eggs, marshmellos, hot dog buns, bagles, and other products to name a few which are left overs he receives from the food pantry. This leftover waste ends up in my front and back yard or under my car, including the bones and scraps. This has also attracted unwanted rodents and other vermin to the area, including excess squirrels, raccoons, crows, mice, and furthermore attracted the stray cat population. The cats now take harbor under my deck and urinate consistently, ruining my yard. The problem is that much of the food which is laid out goes uneaten as these animals are not adapted to eat items, such as marshmallows and corn flakes. Several neighbors, including Edward Steward, residing at 6221 N 63rd St, Milwaukee, WI 53218, also have expressed to me that this debris has become a problem within his yard. We have expressed our dissatisfaction with the problem to Kevin in a pleasant manner, but he does not take our complaints seriously and continues the pattern. This has occurred for over 2 years and has only increased in the past few months. I am seeking help to stop this. I am concerned for my health as I recently found a rodent within my garage, which I know is attributable to this increase in left out waste.

There is a storage room in the basement that has a very musty and mildew-like odor. You can’t see the source of the moisture, but you can smell it. In mid-December I first reported it to him. At first my landlord was very responsive and seemed to care. The first mold specialist that he sent looked at the room and said “oh, it’s a safe mold, if there is any mold” and did no testing whatsoever. Weeks later, I do my own mold testing and pay for it out of my own pocket. I followed the instructions exactly and tested in various areas in the room. Including by the pipe, by the walls (where the first mold specialist assumed there could be mold.) My testing showed Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium was found. One of the samples I did right by the pipe and wall, and that was the most severe. I go to my landlord with all this information and share the reports and he sends a second mold specialist out to do his own testing. That was almost 3 weeks ago on January 13th and I haven’t heard one thing in response from my landlord about the results or any remediation plans. I think this is an uninhabitable condition for ME and MY family. I must be particularly sensitive to molds. A lot of people are so I’m not sure why everyone is downplaying this and not doing any further investigation. My dog is constantly itchy and can’t even stay at the house anymore. I am done being ignored by my landlord and I’m ready to figure out a solution or get me out of this house.""2025-02-01 00:00:00","2496 W FOND DU LAC AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53206-1015","Street Light Out","2025-02-02 00:00:00","Area dark south of Tamarack southbound""2025-02-01 00:00:00","801 E RESERVOIR AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53212-3482","Graffiti","","located in kadish Park at the band shell""2025-01-31 00:00:00","9034 W METCALF PL, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-2752","Christmas Tree Pickup (DO NOT USE)","2025-01-31 00:00:00","""2025-01-31 00:00:00","2625 S 70TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53219-2508","Recycling Cart: No Cart","","The cart has been missing since was damaged for over 1 week.

There is a temporary round a bout at the intersection of 61st & chambers. Someone hit one of the signs so now there are only 3 signs where there should be 4.
